# Musical Loading Screen
**About**
Ever get tired of your 1 song in your loading screen and wish you could have more songs. Well this script may solve your issue. Musical Load Screen can have ‘unlimited’ songs in the loading screen. It will pick a random song and play it whilst you load in. Currently by default there is 5 songs but you can add more easily.

I decided to release this as I only know of 2 servers that have this (Mine & HSG’s). So I’m sharing it today with all of you. If you have issues regarding the sound(s) comment below.

**Installation**
Goto the Wiki tab.

**Requirements**
None. This is a standalone resource

If you can’t host songs yourself. DM me on discord (FAXES#8655) and I can help you.
